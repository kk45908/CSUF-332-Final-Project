# CSUF-332-Final-Project
This is my final project for my file structures and databases class. I took this class at Cal State Fullerton and I worked on this project with Kourosh Alasti and Zhenting Huang.

This project takes test data from the internet and integrates it with a larger mySQL database and demonstrates mySQL searching skills with queries, joins and subqueries.
